    <div id="lorem" class="lorem">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum
      has been the
      industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
      it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
      typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
      containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
      versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>
